Hello, I'm KimSumin.

## Cruella
The movie I watched recently is **Cruella**.

Cruella is a spin-off live-action film of **'101 Dalmatian Dogs'**. It moved the background to the late 70s, dealing with the youth of 'Cruella de Ville'. This is the second live-action movie with Disney villain as the main character, not the original animation character after Maleficent series.
