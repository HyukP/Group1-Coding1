## 2021 Practical Coding - Team 1

Hello, I'm KimSumin. The movie I watched recently is **Cruella**.  

Cruella is a spin-off live-action film of **'101 Dalmatian Dogs'**. It moved the background to the late 70s, dealing with the youth of 'Cruella de Ville'. This is the second live-action movie with Disney villain as the main character, not the original animation character after Maleficent series.
